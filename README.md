# Graph Algorithms ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- ### Hacktober Fest âœ…ðŸ˜Ž
    We hereby welcome coders who wish to contribute to Open Source and participate in  Hacktober Fest 2020.  
    We are looking for <b>Quality</b> and <b>not Quantity</b> 

- ### Languages
    Only **C++**[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B] or **Python**[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)]
    
- ### About the Repository  
    We are focusing on building solutions for problems on Graphs. Hence we are looking for **algorithms** like: 
    
     1. _Backtracking_  
     2. _Breadth First Search_  
     3. _Depth First Search_  
     4. _Traversal Algorithms (Prims/Kruskal)_  
     5. _Dijiktra's Algorithm_  
     6. _A* Algorithm_
     
    You can get good **problem statements on Graphs** from sites like:  
    
     1. <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">GeekForGeeks</a>  
     2. <a href = "https://www.interviewbit.com/">InterviewBit</a>  
     3. <a href = "https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>  
     4. <a href = "https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/">HackerEarth</a>  
     5. <a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>  

- ### How To Contribute  
    - You need to choose a **problem statement**, the solution to which can be derived using Graph Algorithms.
    - Once you choose a problem statement (making sure that it is not present in the repository already), **add a folder** for the problem statement in your forked repository.
    - This repository doesn't promote code in the root of the directory. Hence code has to be in sub-directory.
    - In the folder, there must be **2 files**
    - **README.md & main.cpp**
    - **README.md** to explain the **problem statement**, provide links for **further reference on the problem statement**, and also **mentioning the algorithm** that has been used in your code.
    - **main.cpp** implements code for the given problem statement using an algorithm that is explicitly mentioned in README.md.
    - Make sure the code is in **C++ or Python**
    - **These steps need to followed** while contributing **otherwise your your PR will be considered invalid.**

- ### Guidelines for Contribution
    1. **Fork** the Repository
    2. **Add, edit or enhance** code.
    3. **No duplication, repetition and spamming**. It will not lead to an accepted Pull Request.
    6. Once you are done with your contribution, **issue a PULL REQUEST**. The Maintainer may ask you for a few changes. Once everything seems good, your code will be pulled and added to the original Repository branch.
