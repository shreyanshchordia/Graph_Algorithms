# RAT IN A MAZE

## DESCRIPTION :

You are given a N*N maze with a rat placed at maze[0][0]. Find and print all paths that rat can follow to reach its destination i.e. maze[N-1][N-1]. Rat can move in any direc­tion ( left, right, up and down). Value of every cell in the maze can either be 0 or 1. Cells with value 0 are blocked means rat can­not enter into those cells and those with value 1 are open.

## INPUT FORMAT :

*The first line of input contains an integer M, N representing the dimension of the maze. The next M lines of input contain N space-separated integers representing the type of the cell.*

## OUTPUT FORMAT :

*For each test case, print the path from start position to destination position and only cells that are part of the solution path should be 1, rest all cells should be 0. Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.*

## SAMPLE INPUT :

`3 3`   
`1 0 1`   
`1 0 1`   
`1 1 1`  

## SAMPLE OUTPUT :

`1 0 0`   
`1 0 0`   
`1 1 1`
