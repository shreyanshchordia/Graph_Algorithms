Description:
Articulation points are the nodes in the graph which when removed from the graph results in the increase in the number of connected components of the graph.
Bridges are the edges in the graph which when the removed results in the increase in the number of connected components of the graph.
This algorithm helps to find the Articulation Points in the graph and the Bridges in the graph.
